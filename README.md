### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kanjulv/EHR-System.git
cd EHR-System
Install backend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm install
Install frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
npm install
Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the backend folder with:

env
Copy
Edit
PORT=4000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUD_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUD_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
For frontend, create a .env file in the frontend folder with:

env
Copy
Edit
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
Running the app locally
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
npm start
